  				<h3>The Problem</h3>
  				<p>The problem is two-fold: <strong>clothing sizes are not standardized and women’s bodies are not standardized</strong>.</p>
          <p>This is a more pervasive problem than simple aesthetics. Research has shown that what you wear can actually affect your confidence<sup>1</sup>. Simply put: <strong>looking good can make you feel good</strong>.</p>
          <p>Further, my user interviews showed that <strong>when people can’t find clothes that fit they get frustrated and even disheartened</strong>.</p>

    				<h3>The Solution</h3>
    				<p>By comparing the user’s actual measurements with actual measurements of a large variety of jeans, the app can offer recommendations of jeans that will fit the user’s body type and tell her exactly what size to buy, <strong>alleviating the frustration and disheartenment of not being able to find the correct size</strong>.</p>
            <p>Further with personalized recommendations, <strong>the user will find a pair of jeans that makes them look great and feel great</strong>.</p>

            <h3>The Product</h3>
    				<p>Jeanius is an app to help women of all body types find off-the-shelf jeans that actually fit them.</p>
            <p>Features:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Enter your measurements manually or by taking a picture of yourself with the app</li>
                <li>Get jean recommendations based on actual measurements of the jeans</li>
                <li>See and post review of suggested jeans</li>
                <li>See pictures of other users wearing suggested jeans and post them of yourself</li>

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <span class="anchor" id="user-research"></span>
        <h3 class="mt30">User Interviews</h3>
				<p>I prepared a list of about 15 questions to ask several people. In the first round of interviews I covered a variety of topics to identify many potential pain points.</p>
        <p>I had a hunch that the sizing of clothes was a particular pain point. These interviews confirmed my hunch, so I did a second round of user interviews focusing on sizing.</p>
        <p>Every single woman I spoke to, regardless of body type, identified finding clothes that fit as a pain point.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 mt30 text-left">
        <span class="anchor" id="ideating"></span>
				<h3>Moving towards a solution</h3>
				<p>My first idea was to create an app that would tell the user what size to buy in any store based on their measurements.</p>
        <p>However, various sizing apps already exist partnered with various retailers. My app would offer information from a wider variety of stores not covered by current offerings. However, to accomplish this would require sizing information from each store. Obtaining accurate measurements on every single item of clothing in every single store would be very difficult.</p>
        <p>The alternative would be to use sizing charts. Most stores provide these on their websites, however, they are often difficult to find. The app would pool this information in one place. However, sizing charts can be unreliable.</p>
        <p>So how do I turn this into a workable app that provides reliable information?</p>
        <p>After talking to some more people, and a little head scratching, I decided to limit the scope by focussing on one article of clothing. This would enable my app to use actual measurements making results reliable. I picked jeans because most people wear them and they are relatively standardized.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 mt30 text-left">
        <span class="anchor" id="story-boarding"></span>
        <h3>Storyboard</h3>
        <p>This storyboard was inspired by something told to me in a user interview about how disheartening shopping trips can be when nothing fits.</p>

        <span class="anchor" id="user-flows"></span>
        <h3 class="mt">User Flows</h3>
					<p>To flesh out how the app will actually work I created user flows for each of the major features. Below you can the the overall user flow.</p>
      </div>

        <h3 class="mt">Paper Prototype</h3>
				<p>I then focused on the flow of entering measurements, getting recommendations and looking at the results to create a paper prototype. In this iteration, I cleaned up the design and made it more consistent. In particular, in my initials sketches, the text entry fields were labelled in different ways.</p>
